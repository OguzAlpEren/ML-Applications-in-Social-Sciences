Project Descriptions

Assignment #1

Write up a report on UN World Happiness Data.ipynb

Assignment 1 focuses on analyzing the UN World Happiness Dataset, which measures happiness across different countries using factors like GDP per capita, social support, and life expectancy. The report explores correlations, revealing that higher happiness scores are associated with positive indicators in these areas.

Six models were built and tested:

	1.	Random Forest Classifier (n_estimators=250, max_depth=4)
	2.	GradientBoostingClassifier (n_estimators=45, learning_rate=1.2, max_depth=1)
	3.	Deep Learning model with relu activation and hidden layers (64, 32, 16, 16)
	4.	Random Forest with GridSearchCV (cv=10, max_depth=7, n_estimators=110)
	5.	GradientBoosting with GridSearchCV (cv=10, learning_rate=1.1, max_depth=5, n_estimators=49)
	6.	Complex Deep Learning model with SGD optimizer, batch_size=20, epochs=350, validation_split=0.25

The findings reveal GDP per capita as a strong predictor, while region and generosity show weaker associations. This analysis provides insights for policymakers aiming to improve citizensâ€™ well-being.

Assignment #2

Covid Positive X Ray image data.ipynb

Assignment 2 utilizes a COVID-19 chest X-ray dataset, with the goal of building models to distinguish COVID-19 positive cases from viral pneumonia and normal X-rays. This project aims to support AI-driven diagnostics in medical settings.

Six models were developed:

	1.	Custom CNN architecture
	2.	VGG16 pre-trained model (Transfer Learning)
	3.	ResNet50V2 Model (Transfer Learning)
	4.	Improved CNN with L2 Regularization
	5.	Improved VGG16 (Transfer Learning)
	6.	Improved ResNet50V2 (Transfer Learning)

Model enhancements included regularization, dropout layers, and transfer learning. Models 5 and 6 performed best for generalization, highlighting their potential in COVID-19 diagnostics with varied datasets.

Assignment #3

Text Classification Using the Stanford SST Sentiment Dataset.ipynb

Assignment 3 focuses on the Stanford SST Sentiment Dataset, which categorizes movie review sentences as positive, negative, or neutral. This sentiment analysis project has applications for businesses, investors, and content creators.

Six models were tested:

	1.	Simple LSTM model
	2.	1D CNN with GlobalMaxPooling
	3.	LSTM with pre-trained GloVe embeddings
	4.	Bidirectional LSTM
	5.	CNN with multiple filter sizes
	6.	Bidirectional LSTM with GloVe embeddings, dropout, and recurrent dropout

Models 3 and 6 achieved the highest accuracy (0.8057 and 0.8299). The use of pre-trained GloVe embeddings, bidirectional layers, and dropout layers in Model 6 significantly improved performance, showcasing the value of advanced techniques in sentiment analysis.
